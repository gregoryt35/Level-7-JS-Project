        <h3 style="color: navy">At the beginning of the game, you will rearrange your ships and commence fighting.<br>
        You will try finding the location of your opponent's ships by guessing where they are located,<br>
        and the goal is to eliminate all of your opponents ships. Be warned, you will be playing against<br>
        a highly trained AI that has never lost. Good luck, soldier.</h3>
